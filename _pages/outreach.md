While I'm not a very chatty person in my everyday life, one of the activity that I prefer the most is **reaching out to people** and talk about evolution and biology. The expression people have when they are enjoying science is definetely priceless!

That is the reason why in 2017 I engaged with **[BioPills](https://www.biopills.net/)**, an Italian science-communication project that wants to communicate the beauty of life sciences in an effective mannner but without forgetting factual accuracy.

At the moment, I am the chief editor of the "Environment and Nature" section of the website. I am also in charge of organizing hikings in different Italian natural settings, in order to let people escape from the urban routine while directly immersing themselves in field-based learning of biology.

Unfortunatly, the website is currently only in Italian, but if you are interested in learning more about it, don't esistate to get in touch!
