Despite I'm not a very talkative person in my everyday life, one of the activity that I prefer the most is **reaching out to people** and talk about evolution and biology. The way in which people looks at you when you are making them enjoying science is definetely priceless!

That is the reason why in 2017 I engaged with **[BioPills](https://www.biopills.net/)**, an Italian science-communication project that wants to communicate the beauty of life sciences in an effective mannner but without forgetting the importance of fact checking.

At the moment, I am the leading editor of the "Environment and Nature" section of the website. I am also in charge of organizing hikings in different Italian natural locations, in order to let people escape from the urban routine while learning about biology directly in the field.

Unfortunatly, the website is currently only in Italian, but if you are interested in learning more about it, feel free to get in touch!
