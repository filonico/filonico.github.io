## Introduction to bioinformatics

In my GitHub personal page you can find a **[brief introduction to bioinformatics](https://github.com/filonico/UNIX_and_bash_basics)**. There, I explain the most common bash commands that bioinformaticians usually deal with.

Take it as a friendly resource for accessing commonly used commands in early bioinformatics.
