## Introduction to bioinformatics

<div style="text-align: justify">
In my GitHub personal page you can find a <b><a href="https://github.com/filonico/UNIX_and_bash_basics" target="_blank">brief introduction to bioinformatics</a></b>. There, I explain the most common bash commands that bioinformaticians usually deal with.
      
<br />
<br />

Take it as a friendly resource for accessing commonly used commands in early bioinformatics.

## Illustration portfolio

<div style="text-align: justify">
In my free-time I also like drawing. And sometimes I try to merge this hobby with my research work and get <b>custom illustrations</b> to use on papers and/or other publications.

<br />
<br />

At the moment I am mostly <b>self-trained</b>, as I just attended a virtual course in nature illustration in 2021.
But I hope one day to be able to get some more professional trainig.

<br />

<li><b>Animal icons</b>. These have been used to decorate phylogenetic trees, plots and other paper figures. Up to now, I've mostly focused on organisms that I personally study.
