  Hello everyone and welcome! I am Filippo Nicolini, a <b>Research Associate</b>
  at the University of Leicester (UK) in the
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/feudalab/home" target="_blank">Feuda Lab</a>.
  Previously, I was a PhD student at the University of Bologna (Italy) working
  with people from the
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/evo-com-unibo/home" target="_blank">
    EVO · COM research group
  </a>.
</p>

<p>
  My main scientific interest regards evolutionary zoology, with particular
  attention to <b>evolutionary genomics</b>, <b>evo-devo</b>, and the molecular
  basis of phenotypic diversity.
</p>

<p>
  During my PhD, I mainly focused on <b>comparative genomics of bivalves</b> and
  of genes involved in <b>sex determination</b>. The rationale was to understand
  patterns of molecular evolution and genome dynamics of sex-determination–
  related genes, along with their transcription and expression localization
  during early embryogenesis of the Mediterranean mussel. I also worked on
  crustacean comparative genomics, particularly within Branchiopoda, to explore
  how variation in genome size affects genome structure and life-history traits.
</p>

<p>
  My current postdoctoral research focuses on the <b>evolution of vision in early
  metazoans</b>, integrating bioinformatics and wet-lab approaches. In
  particular, I leverage cutting-edge single-cell transcriptomics to understand
  how cell types evolved during the early phases of animal evolution.
</p>

<p>
  Alongside my academic work, I am deeply committed to science outreach.
  <b>I firmly believe that doing good science also means communicating it
  effectively</b>. Engaging with broader audiences helps make science more
  accessible and understandable, not only for the general public but also for
  scientists themselves. Clear science communication shapes how people perceive
  the surrounding world—and how we academics understand our own research.
