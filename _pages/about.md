Hello everyone! I am Filippo Nicolini, a **PhD student** at the University of Bologna working with people from the [EVO Â· COM research group](https://sites.google.com/view/evo-com-unibo/home).

My main scientific interest regards evolutionary zoology and, within my PhD, I would really love to improve my ability to study the reciprocal interplay between the **evolution of genomes** and the **evolution of complex traits** in order to undersdtand how the two processes influence each other.

Not by chance, my PhD is mainly focused on **bivalve comparative genomics** with a particular interest for genes involved in **sex determination**, in the attempt to understand their patterns of molecular evolution and genome dynamics. Besides bioinformatics, I am also trying to make use of *wet lab* techniques (such ad karyology and mRNA *in-situ* hybridization) in order to gain more comprehensive investigations on bivalves sex determination.

In the meanwhile, I am also engaged with comparative genomics analyses in **branchiopod crustaceans** and **walking sticks** to unravel the genomic bases of **morphological stasis** and **re-evolution of wings**, respectively.

Enjoy my page and feel free to get in touch!!
