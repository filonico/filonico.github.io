  Hello everyone and welcome to my page! I am Filippo Nicolini, a <b>PhD student</b> at the University of Bologna working with people from the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/evo-com-unibo/home" target="_blank">EVO Â· COM research group</a>.
  
  <br />
  <br />
  
  My main scientific interest regards evolutionary zoology and, within my PhD, I would really love to improve my ability to study the reciprocal interplay between the <b>evolution of genomes</b> and the <b>evolution of complex traits</b> in order to understand how the two processes influence each other.
  
  <br />
  <br />
  
  My PhD is mainly focused on <b>bivalve comparative genomics</b> with a particular interest for genes involved in <b>sex determination</b>, in the attempt to understand their patterns of molecular evolution and genome dynamics. Alongside bioinformatics, I am also leveraging several <i>wet lab</i> techniques (such as HCR mRNA-FISH and karyology) to gain a more comprehensive investigation of bivalves sex determination.
  
  <br />
  <br />
  
  I am also engaged in other research lines, consisting on comparative genomics analyses in <b>branchiopod crustaceans</b> and <b>walking sticks</b> to unravel the genomic bases of <b>morphological stasis</b> and <b>re-evolution of wings</b>, respectively.
