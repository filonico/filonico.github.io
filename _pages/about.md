  Hello everyone and welcome! I am Filippo Nicolini, a <b>Research Associate</b> at the University of Leicester (UK) in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/feudalab/home" target="blank">Feuda Lab</a>. Previously, I was a PhD student at the University of Bologna (Italy) working with people from the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/evo-com-unibo/home" target="_blank">EVO · COM research group</a>.
  
  <br><br>
  
  My main scientific interest regards evolutionary zoology, with particular attention to <b>evolutionary genomics</b>, <b>evo-devo</b>, and the molecular basis of phenotypic diversity.
  
  During my PhD, I mainly focused on <b>comparative genomics of bivalves</b> and of genes involved in <b>sex determination</b>. The rationale was to understand the patterns of molecular evolution and genome dynamics of sex-determination related genes, along with their transcription and expression localization in the early embryogenesis of the Mediterranean mussel. I also got to deal with crustacean comparative genomics, particularly within the class Branchiopoda, to understand how the variation in genome sizes affected the overall genome structure and the evolution of life-history traits.
  
  <br><br>
  
  My current postdoc position revolves around the <b>evolution of vision in early metazoans</b>, leveraging both bioinformatics and wet-lab. Specifically, I am leveraging cutting edge single-cell transcriptomics to understand how cell types had evolved during the early phases of animal evolution.
  
  <br><br>

  Alongside my academic work, I am also deeply commited to science outreach. <b>I firmly believe that doing good science also means communicating it effectively</b>. Engaging with broader audiences helps make science more accessible and understandable, not just for the general public, but also for scientists themeselves. Clear science communication shapes the way people see the surrounding world, as well as the way we academics understand our own research.
