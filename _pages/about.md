  Hello everyone and welcome! I am Filippo Nicolini, a <b>Research Associate</b> at the University of Leicester (UK) in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/feudalab/home" target="blank">Feuda Lab</a>. Previously, I was a PhD student at the University of Bologna (Italy) working with people from the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/evo-com-unibo/home" target="_blank">EVO · COM research group</a>.
  
  <br />
  <br />
  
  My main scientific interest regards evolutionary zoology and, within my PhD, I would really love to improve my ability to study the reciprocal interplay between the <b>evolution of genomes</b> and the <b>evolution of complex traits</b> in order to understand how the two processes influence each other.
  
  <br />
  <br />
  
  My current postdoc revolves around a project focused on the <b>evolution of vision in early metazoans</b>, leveraging both bioinformatics and wet-lab. My PhD was instead mainly focused on <b>bivalve comparative genomics</b> with a particular interest for genes involved in <b>sex determination</b>, in the attempt to understand their patterns of molecular evolution and genome dynamics, as well as their transcription and/or expression during early developmental stages.
  
  <br />
  <br />
  
  I am also engaged in other research lines, consisting on comparative genomics analyses in <b>branchiopod crustaceans</b> and <b>walking sticks</b> to unravel the genomic bases of <b>morphological stasis</b> and <b>re-evolution of wings</b>, respectively.
